**EVAN REESE** does Industrial Design. He believes that the things we use should be simple. It sounds obvious, but we have all interacted with many products that got lost somewhere along the way. Evan is one of many working to end that.

He has worked as project lead for products ranging from fun and durable consumer electronics, to medical products designed to meet FDA guidelines. Working with Griffin Technology, over seventy of his designs reached production, with several million units produced. He is experienced in partnering with foreign manufacturers and has spent time in China overseeing production of his projects. He has also worked at a New York City design consultancy, ECCO, where he did design work for clients including Panasonic and Lenovo.

When he isnâ€™t creating intuitive products that boost brand value, you might find him riding a bike home from work, seeing how fast he can fingerpick some guitar strings, or hiding behind a lamp from his two hilarious children.
