**DAVE SEEMAN** does Mechanical Engineering. He believes abundant value will be created from the limitless number of solutions waiting to be built, and he’s eager to play a part in making them.


Dave studied mechanical engineering to become a design engineer, but he was always interested in the full product development lifecycle. Dave has worked in engineering, technical sales, and marketing at big companies and startups alike. Eventually he put these skills together and founded a web startup, a process to which he credits learning some quintessential lessons. Since then, Dave has worked on projects ranging from a large scale 3D printer at UT Knoxville and Oak Ridge National Lab, to material handling at the Uranium Processing Facility in Oak Ridge, to creating consumer and medical products in Nashville.


When Dave’s not his using his business or engineering skills, he’s usually working on a side project to learn something new. You might also find him reading, hiking or doing yoga with his wife, or making some homemade hot sauce.
