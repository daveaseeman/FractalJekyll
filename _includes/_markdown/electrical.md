Electrical engineering is the brains of your product. We refer to our product requirements list to choose the components that we need to do what we want to do. Selection and arrangement of these components drives the size, shape, and cost of the final unit. We are capable of analog and digital designs and are experienced in wireless and wearable technologies.
