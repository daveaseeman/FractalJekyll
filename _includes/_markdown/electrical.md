These days, the IoT (internet of things) trend is exploding. We want to be there to help. We start with your ‘wish list’ and create a schematic design where functionality is priority 1 and cost is a close second. Then we move on to PCB design and order a physical circuit board. This is a recursive process where we complete testing and make small revisions until the device is functioning perfectly and is ready to be mass produced.
