   I've worked with Mitch Meiss at Fractal Hardware on several occasions and
   have recommended him to friends. His knowledge of PCB layout, vendors,
   parts, cost alternatives, is exceptional. Not only is he talented in the
   technical arena, but his ethical handling of work issues is one of his
   strong points. Obviously, I recommend him and his colleagues highly!

   These guys are professionals. Dave and his team are exceptional at what
   they do. I came to them with an idea and they brought it to life. Not

   keeping me updated on timelines and ensuring all my needs and wants for my
   product were met. I am beyond thrilled with the finished product.
